#Seattle Alerts

The app notifies subscribers by email if activity occurs within a chosen radius of their address. Seattle Alerts converts JSON 911 data from data.seattle.gov and displays markers via the google maps API.

Seattle Alerts receives data from data.seattle.gov which utilizes an API produced by Socrata. The City of Seattle reports that the dataset is refreshed on a 4 hour interval, but appears to be updated more frequently. The 911 Fire data set is updated every five minutes.
